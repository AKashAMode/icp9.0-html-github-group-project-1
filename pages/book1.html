    <h1>The Power of Your Subconscious Mind</h1>
<div>
    Today we are here with the summary of the book, which is also a part of the collection of our favourite books,<br><br> 
    “The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,” <br>
    by <b>“Dr. Joseph Murphy.”</b><br><Br>

Joseph Murphy explains in this book that if we pray correctly, our prayers will always work.<br> 
But why do our prayers not work? This is because we don’t focus on one thing with all our <br>
hearts and mind and don’t follow the proper technique.<br> <br>

That’s why our prayers don’t work.<br><br> 

Your prayers respond to your inner belief and react to your mental images or thoughts. Therefore, your wish is a prayer.<br><br>

If you know the subconscious mind, there will be magic in your life, <br>
which can happen to anyone if we understand how our subconscious mind works.<br> 
The subconscious has many powers you cannot even imagine in your dreams. For example, <br>
have you ever had this question – why is a person successful, and why is someone unsuccessful?<br>
Why are some people wealthy and some poor? Why do some have good health, and why do some remain sick?<br> 
If you also have this question, this summary can be exceptional.<br><br>

<i><b>So let us understand the real power of our subconscious mind in detail.<br></b></i>

    <h3>Chapter 1. The Treasure House within You </h3>
    <img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bSUUoqC7pjCNlq1KJ8lyUTwxLfmcqtlqZYLWMOWgPbl5XNvfJ_m1qGFNdcq3PjWJwEreMDCuRaEpEHoCtxnWYjmLD3JWicTX2hoR-hN7xRDa3RtySILPBdYemBwKVAVGZL2dgkXLW-j6nW6_cxuA4J4"height=300><br>
    A vast treasure is hidden inside you; you have to open your eyes and see it. You must be aware that if we magnetize an iron rod, it can lift one time more weight than its weight. 

And if we take away its magnetic power from iron, it cannot lift a feather. The same happens with us. So magnetized people are confident, and non-magnetic people doubt themselves and cannot handle their burdens.

And the answer to all these problems lies in your powerful subconscious mind. 

Our subconscious mind is so powerful that if we plant deep down in our hearts why we want to become the wealthiest and most successful man in the world, our subconscious mind will start making way for us.

Everyone thinks, is this the subconscious mind? Your question is correct! The subconscious mind is our unconscious mind which controls your breathing, heartbeat, blood circulation, and all subconscious activities. The point of thinking now is that if your subconscious mind can keep you alive, then it can also fulfil the wish taken in your mind. 

If we tell you in simple language, first of all, decide your goal, it can be anything, to become the world’s most prosperous or prominent business person.

So if you have understood the technique of sending this message to your subconscious mind, you will not have to work hard. Your subconscious mind controls your body and can also control your actions; that’s why your subconscious mind will do your work. You must have heard many people say that you listen to the voice of your reason. Voice of the mind means to make your subconscious mind your friend and become the world’s best doctor, engineer, businessman, investor, or whatever you want.

Don’t you find it strange that Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, how did they become so wealthy and successful at such a young age? If you grasp this summary till the end, we promise you will become a master at controlling your subconscious mind.

Imagine that whatever you write on paper, you can quickly complete that work with the powers of your subconscious mind. Likewise, you can easily crack any difficult exam by managing the subconscious mind. 

The subconscious mind will increase both your focus and productivity.

If we divide it into two parts to understand the mind, then their names would be – the conscious mind and the other is the subconscious mind. The conscious mind is your logical brain which works on understanding. So your conscious mind is under your control. And your subconscious mind controls your involuntary actions means what you cannot control. So the conscious mind has 10% of your brain, and your subconscious mind has 90% power. 

And this is where people make mistakes. 

Those who are toppers in studies or very successful use both the conscious and subconscious minds. 

This means 100% and those who are weak in studies and career life; those people use only their conscious mind, which is 10%, and that’s why they cannot succeed.

    <h2>Chapter 2. How Your Mind Works</h2>
    <p>
        How your mind works: The conscious mind takes information from our five senses and makes decisions by experiencing things. But the subconscious mind does not accept any conclusion; it acts by following the base conscious mind’s previous beliefs, experiences, and habits.

Power of suggestion: Your subconscious mind is compassionate if it is suggested. You can understand this concept like this. 

If the subconscious mind is a vast ship, then your conscious mind is its captain who gives orders on where to go. 

Your conscious mind filters all the wrong information with logic and reasoning. And the same report goes to our subconscious mind.

Once upon a time, a woman was an excellent singer and had a competition. However, she was afraid to go on stage, and she failed once due to stage fright. So she took the help of positive affirmations and said, “I am the best singer and going to give my best performance on the main stage.” And in the same way, that woman kept repeatedly saying in her mind, and the result was that she got the first prize in the competition.

Your subconscious mind never questions you, and it has all the answers. Habitual thinking means the neutral pattern of what you think daily is stored in your subconscious mind. That’s why you can’t make any habit so easily. You must have heard that think about positive things for 5 minutes before sleeping at night. We will tell you it’s a complete working process so that you can program yourself in a day. Like you design characters in mobile games, you can design a new character for yourself.

You can use your full potential when there is good interaction between the conscious and subconscious minds. And if we learn to use the conscious and the subconscious mind together, we can have whatever you want. But in the work in which you want to be successful, you will have to give time and effort.

We explain to you in simple language. 

Our life has two worlds: an inner world and an outer world. The inner world is called what we think day and night. The battle starts in our minds. We think something else and do something else. We all must have noticed that as soon as a new song is released, you listen to it again and again, And that song goes on in your mind for days. Then, you start humming it in your mind. This is the inner world. And the second is the outer world; your friends, family, and school come into the external world.

And many people react by looking at the outside world. “Why does this only happen to me? Why didn’t I get promoted? I have bad luck!” and many more. And those who understand their inner world and outer world and control it according to themselves, those people are successful in life. Those people are in seventh heaven and are the king of their life.

    <h2>Chapter 3. The Miracle Working Power of Your Subconscious </h2>
    <p>
        Our subconscious mind can do wonders for us; We work from morning till night, and when we come home at night, we rest and sleep. 

        But wait! Does Your Subconscious Mind Fall Asleep? No!!!!!
        
        Your subconscious mind never sleeps. 
        
        He keeps working for you 24/7. 
        
        Our heart beats to keep you alive. 
        
        Our soul can understand our subconscious mind. It does not depend on time and space. This can end all your sorrows and pains now, Right now! Here we give you a simple real-life example.
        
        We must have heard about hypnotizing people and how experts can easily hypnotize anyone; Do you know? Experts can make us cock, martial artists, and anything else by controlling the subconscious level of our brains. The same we can also search on YouTube for “TEDx Hypnotism,” where we can see how experts can easily play with anyone’s subconscious mind and control them and earn lakhs of rupees in stage performance.
        
        Now we will know whether our subconscious mind can cure our disease. Ha! Absolutely can. According to a recent report, the world’s best doctors and advanced treatments failed, but this miracle was still possible. But what was that miracle recovery?”
        
        There was a wealthy man whose plane had crashed, and almost all his bones were broken. And all the doctors had given up hope that he could not be cured, and many believed that he would survive only for a few days. But, the man he is, he made up his mind with a strong belief that I would be wonderful by Christmas.
        
        And that man didn’t listen to anyone and kept saying that one thought in his mind day and night. He used to visualize himself as “How he came out of the hospital walking on his feet on Christmas day. That man kept that one positive thought in his mind for eight months. In his subconscious mind, all the positive thoughts and His positive attitude were clear, due to which the man walked on his own feet on Christmas day.
        
        A man who had broken 103 bones walked on his feet in 8 months. This is the power of the subconscious mind, and if you want to read this story, you can search on google. “Miracle Man – Story of Morris Goodman.” From this story, you can also learn how to use your brain’s magical powers by focusing on one thought.
        
        Now we will know how you can send the desired message to your subconscious mind, which will make you successful. 
        
        You must have heard that every powerful thing has some weakness. And if we know that, you too can hack your mind like computer hacking and get the desired result.
        
        You can send your message to this magical subconscious mind before sleeping at night and after waking up in the morning. We must have heard this many times before sleeping at night and after waking up. Do you know exactly what happens to our brain so that the message goes directly to your subconscious level? The last 5 minutes are significant for you when you go to sleep.
        
        Because in the last 5 minutes, your subconscious mind is 95% active and only 75% functional in the daytime. 
        
        That’s why we have to program our brain only in the last 5 minutes, With which we can control anything. For example, you write your message on a piece of paper and then record it on your phone, and after doing this, you put it in repeat mode.
        
        And as soon as you put your phone in repeat mode, you must do deep breathing ten times by keeping the phone on the side. Due to this, your mind will be completely calm, and you will start falling asleep. 
        
        And as soon as you start falling asleep, start listening to your recorded day with your earphone and feel completely relaxed. But, of course, while listening to the recording, you have to visualize your message intensely. And this has to be done till you fall asleep. And the next day, you will observe that the message you put in the last 5 minutes of last night is the same message running through your mind all day.
        
        Do many people ask why to visualize this? What happens with visualization? 
        
        So your question is correct. Our subconscious mind only understands the language of emotions and cannot understand logic. Therefore, whatever you see and visualize, your subconscious mind cannot differentiate because your subconscious mind does not question you.
        
         It is the work of the conscious mind to answer questions. That is why your subconscious mind cannot understand what is true or false. Your subconscious mind is like a child – it will do what you tell it.

    <h2>Chapter 4. Mental Healing In Ancient Times </h2>
    <p>How did the people of old times do mental healing? And he used to get well very soon. In the olden days, people believed a lot in the 3 step formula. That’s the formula – ask, believe, and receive. “That is, ask for what you want, believe that you have it, feel that you have it, and that thing will be with you in the coming times.” You will think how simple it is to say!!!! Ask, believe, and you will receive.

        We told you about the Miracle Man who survived the plane crash. So, in the same way, that man used his subconscious mind in this 3 step formula. Also, you have to focus on one thought and visualization. This thing will not happen in a day. If you don’t reach your subconscious mind, what you want to happen, that thing cannot happen.</p>

        Meaning Of Absent Treatment
        
        A woman who lived in Los Angeles suffered from coronary thrombosis. She did not want to die in jail, so she prayed:-
        
        Wherever I am, all my mother’s blessings are with me. My mother is with me, and I can never fall ill as long as my mother is with me. But, as that woman’s body was, it reflected her thoughts. That woman said, I know if I tell the views of my mind, my health will start recovering automatically. And after a few weeks, the woman was cured. And she was cured as if she had never had any disease.

        If you consider your mother as God, then for your subconscious mind, your mother is God who removes all your problems. So we feel complete with our mother, and you can build your confidence similarly.

    <h2>Chapter 5. Practical Techniques in Mental healing </h2>
    <p>1:- Passing over technique 

        If we accept our desires from the conscious mind, which is logically possible, then our conscious mind sends your request to the subconscious mind. And as much as you repeatedly repeat in your conscious mind, “I am very successful in life, I am very good in studies or whatever you want.” Then, after a time, your conscious mind opens the lid of your mind. And that information goes straight into your subconscious, and you start acting the same way.
        2: – Visualisation technique
        
        First of all, we have to calm our minds. And then, just like we see anything with our eyes, similarly, you have to close your eyes and see your goal in imagination. Precisely, we have to see the same in our minds. 
        
        Here we share a real-life example that will make everything clear to you. “Nicola Tesla first used to visualize any new invention in his mind. And then he used to rotate 3D in the same image and see its details.” Similarly, you also have to have a clear visualization.
        3:- Mental Movie Method 
        
        The old saying goes, “a picture is worth a thousand words.” A picture can explain a thousand words as you act so that you will become.
        
        The mental Movie Method is most commonly used in the property-selling business. Let us understand how it is used. We have to satisfy ourselves first in our minds. And think, the price of the property you have kept is the best for the buyers. And after doing this, calm your mind and relax for a while. Let go of all the troubles that have made me sleepy. That is, you have to go into a state of sleep, and the sleepy state will significantly reduce all your mental limitations.
        
        Now visualize the check of the property and feel that the review is in your hands. Be happy with yourself, feel like you got your money, and be thankful for your check now because the grateful man gets much more than that. 
        
        And the man who is not thankful, even what he has, is taken away.
        
        And now you leave it to the universe by saying thanks. And whatever you have visualized throughout the night will keep revising in your subconscious.</p>
