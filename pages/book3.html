these spiritual values can be lived in our lives today. And he has a great sense of
humour which allows us to remember the lessons. His teachings can be applied

        <h3>Preface</h3>
        Have you ever experienced the Indian monsoon? It brings one of the fiercest,
most thunderous downpours of water from the heavens. If you’re caught in the
heavy rain, it’s nearly impossible to stay dry. Similarly, it is hard not to get
caught up in the challenges and negative situations of the world. Feeling
peaceful, happy and content is not about avoiding challenges in our life, but
about how we navigate through these challenges to reach the type of life we
want to live.
Aldous Huxley said, ‘Experience is not what happens to a man, it is what a
man does with what happens to him.’ It’s how we respond that makes all the
difference. If there is one possession we have that is the most valuable and can
truly transform our lives completely, it is our free will. We are the authors of our
own life stories. Challenges and difficulties may fall upon us, just as the
monsoon rains fall upon our head. We don’t seek them or solicit them. They just
come our way. We must choose how to respond.
Happiness does not come automatically. From a young age we receive
methodical education in a variety of areas and fields, but happiness is usually not
one of them. To live a happy life, with integrity and with balance, is one of life’s
amazing secrets which is revealed within this book. These are simple principles
that can be used by anyone to experience a sense of satisfaction.
Do you ever feel irritable or frustrated? Do you ever feel that life isn’t going
your way? Do you ever feel that there is a key part of your life that needs
attention? If the answer to any or all of these questions is a yes, it’s a sign that
your life is probably out of balance. The secret of life is finding balance: not too
much, not too little. Just as a car balances on four wheels, we must balance the
four crucial areas of our life: our personal life, our relationships, our work life
and our social contribution.
Balance on an external level is about the alignment of the wheels. It is about
adjusting our priorities based on the need of the moment, and focusing on that
particular wheel which is out of alignment. At some points in our lives our work
life may need more focus than our personal life. Have you ever wanted to spend
time with someone who needs to meet a project deadline at work? It’s
impossible. They are too busy reaching their target. At other times our personal
life may take precedence over everything else. Have you ever asked a couple
organizing their wedding to spend more time at work? It’s unreasonable to do so
as they are planning one of the most important days of their lives. Dear friends,
we must be willing to adjust our priorities to bring those wheels into alignment.
However, a deeper aspect of balance that resides within us is about our
attitudes and values that we have explored in the different sections of this book.
That attitude is like the air in the tyres of the car. If the tyres of the car are not at
the correct pressure, there can be a puncture, stopping us from getting to our
destination. This is why we have to navigate the internal aspects of balance. If
the external tenets of balance are adjustment and alignment, then the internal
ones are attitude and values.
As we balance ourselves externally and internally, it is fundamental to our
success that we never let go of the steering wheel—our spirituality. If all the
wheels are in proper alignment, if the air pressure in the tyres is optimal, but we
do not have the steering wheel in our hands, we still will not be able to reach
where we want to go. It was the Buddha who said, ‘Just as a candle cannot burn
without fire, we cannot live without a spiritual life.’ Spirituality, in whatever
genuine form of practice, brings purpose to our life and gives us a destination
worth going to. At times we may feel empty or lost or have an existential crisis,
when we feel that we do not know where our life is taking us. It is at those times
that we must hold the steering wheel of spirituality tightly and press on. The
steering wheel comprises four pieces: our spiritual practice (sadhana), the
association that we keep (sanga), our character (sadachar) and our service to
God and to others (seva). When all these aspects of the steering wheel are
adhered to properly, they give us the ability to drive the car of our life towards its
destination.
Let’s get there, together.
