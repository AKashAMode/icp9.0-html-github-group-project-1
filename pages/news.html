    <p><h3>The 147th Lord Jagannath’s annual Rath Yatra festival ended for the day today, with the chariots set to be pulled tomorrow (Monday). The Yatra is going to be a two-day affair after 53 years. President Droupadi Murmu is also scheduled to witness the Rath Yatra today, along with lakhs of devotees in the pilgrim town. The festival usually organised in a single was last held for two days in 1971.

        The Yatra rolled out from the 400-year-old Lord Jagannath temple in Gujarat’s Jamalpur area this morning. Union Home Minister Amit Shah performed the ‘mangla aarti’ and Gujarat Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel performed ‘pahind vidhi’, the ritual of cleaning the way using a golden broom.
        
        What security arrangements are in place in Puri? A crowd of about 10-15 lakh is expected at the festival venue. The Odisha government with the Centre has made arrangements for 180 platoons (one platoon comprises 30 personnel) of security personnel to be deployed to look after the law and order and manage the crowds during the festival. Artificial Intelligence-based CCTV cameras have also been installed. A buffer zone has been planned for the President, while there’s going to be VIP zone for the Odisha governor, chief minister, Union ministers and other dignitaries.</h3></p>
