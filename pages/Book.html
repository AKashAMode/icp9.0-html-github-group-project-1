        “The Power of Your Subconscious Mind”</a>, <br><br> <b>Dr. Joseph Murphy </b> <br><br>
        explains that if we pray correctly, <br>
        our prayers will always work.<br>
         But why do our prayers not work? <br>
         This is because we don’t focus on one<br>
          thing with all our hearts and mind and don’t <br>
          follow the proper technique. The book intends to <br>
          enlighten us with the right techniques so <br>
          that we increase our focus and rewire our <br>
          subconscious mind to work in our advantage. <br>

        The Book of Life</a><br><br>
        <b>J Krishnamurti</b><br><br>
      Inspired by Krishnamurti’s perception<br>
      that truth is found through life itself,<br>
      and not away from it, The Book of Life presents 365 <br>
      quotations from his talks and writings, <br>
      one for each day of the year.<br>
      These timeless daily meditations,<br>
      developed thematically over seven days, <br>
      shed brilliant light on the problems of <br>
      our daily life as well as on the illusions <br>
      that we get into in the process of either solving<br>
      them or looking outside of ourselves<br>
      for a state of happiness and enlightenment.<br><br>
