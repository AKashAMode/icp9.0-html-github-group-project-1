  Ivan is standing on his own in the corner while the men from the chess club move the chairs and tables around. The men are saying things to one another like: Back a bit there, Tom. Mind yourself now. Alone, Ivan is standing, wanting to sit down but uncertain which of the chairs need to be rearranged still and which are in their correct places already. This uncertainty arises because the way in which the men are moving the furniture corresponds to no specific method Ivan has been able to discern. A familiar arrangement is slowly beginning to emerge—a central U shape composed of ten tables, with ten chairs along the outer rim of the shape, and a general seating area around the outside—but the process by which the men are reaching this arrangement seems haphazard. Standing on his own in the corner, Ivan thinks with no especially intense focus about the most efficient method of arranging, say, a random distribution of a given number of tables and chairs into the aforementioned shape. It’s something he has thought about before, while standing in other corners, watching other people move similar furniture around similar indoor spaces: the different approaches you could use, if you happened to be writing a computer program to maximize process efficiency. The accuracy of these particular men would be, Ivan thinks, pretty low, like actually very low.
  </p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>   
          While he’s thinking, a door opens—not the main town-hall door but a smaller fire-exit door at the side—and a woman enters. She’s carrying a set of keys. The other men hardly seem to notice her entrance: they just glance over in her direction and then away again. No one says anything to her. It’s probably one of those situations other people find instantly comprehensible, and everyone other than Ivan has already worked out at a glance exactly who this woman is and why she’s here. She happens to be very attractive, he notices, which makes her presence in the room all the more mysterious. After a moment, Ivan sees that the other men, although they have not directly acknowledged the woman, seem to be behaving differently, lifting the tables with heftier motions of their arms and shoulders, as if the tables have become heavier since she walked in. Showing off in front of her, he realizes, and he even seems to see her smiling to herself, maybe because she has come to the same conclusion or maybe because they’re all pretending to ignore her. Now, perhaps noticing Ivan watching, she looks back at him, a friendly kind of relieved look, and with her keys in her hand she approaches the corner where he’s standing.

    <div>
    <p>
        Hello there, she says. My name is Margaret. I’m a member of staff here. I’m sorry to ask, but do you know whether the little man has arrived yet? This chess prodigy. I think we’re supposed to keep an eye on him.<br>
        
        He looks down at her. She has said all this in a smiling, funny, almost apologetic tone, as if sharing a joke with him. She looks somewhat older than he is, he thinks, not a lot older—in her thirties, he would guess. Ah, he says. You mean Ivan Koubek?<p>
        </div>
        
    <div>
          <p>
        That’s right, she says. Is he here?<br>
        
        Yes. I am him.<br>
        
        She gives an embarrassed flutter of laughter at this, lifting her hand to her chest, jangling her set of keys. Oh, my God, she says. I’m so sorry. Crossed wires, obviously. I thought . . . I don’t know why. I thought you were about twelve.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
        Well, I was once, he says.<br>
        
        She laughs again at that, sincerely it seems, and the feeling of making her laugh is so nice that he also starts to smile, even though he knows she’ll see his braces that way. Ah, that explains it, she says. No, I am sorry, how silly of me. Did you have an O.K. time getting here?<br>
        
        He goes on looking at her a moment, and then, as if belatedly hearing her question, he replies quickly: Oh, right, it was O.K. I got the bus. Still gently smiling, she says: And I was told you might need a lift back to your accommodation after the event, is that right?</p>
      </div>

        <p>
       He pauses again. Her eyes are friendly and encouraging. Definitely it would be creepy of him to read too much into her friendly looks, since she’s literally at work right now, being paid to stand here talking to him. Although, he remembers, he is also kind of at work, being paid to stand here talking to her, even if it’s not really the same. Yeah, he says. I don’t know where it is exactly, the accommodation. But I guess I could get a taxi.<br>
        
        She’s putting her keys into the pocket of her skirt. No, no, she says. We’ll look after you, don’t worry.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
        The club captain comes over finally and introduces himself. His name is Ollie; he’s the one who collected Ivan from the bus station earlier. The woman says again that her name is Margaret, and then Ollie lifts his hand in Ivan’s direction, saying: And this is our guest, Ivan Koubek. She exchanges a glance with Ivan, just a very quick glance of amusement shared between the two of them, and then she answers: Yes, I know. Ollie begins talking to her about the event, what time it will begin and end and which of the studio rooms they’ll be using tomorrow morning for the workshop. In silence, Ivan watches them talking together. She works here, the woman named Margaret, here at the arts center: that explains her sort of artistic appearance. She’s wearing a white blouse, and a voluminous patterned skirt in different colors, and neat flat shoes of the kind ballerinas wear. He begins to experience, while she stands there in front of him, an involuntary mental image of kissing her on the mouth: not even really an image, but an idea of an image, a realization that it will be possible to visualize this at some later point, what it would be like to kiss her, a promise of enjoyment simply to picture himself doing that, which is harmless enough, only a private thought. And yet he also feels at the same time an abrupt desire to draw her attention back to him in real life, which he suspects he could do just by addressing her, just by saying something or asking a question aloud, it doesn’t even matter what.<br>
        Do you play chess? he asks.
      </p>
        </div>

       <div>
        <p>
        They both look up at him. Too late now, he realizes he’s being weird. He can see it, it’s perceptible in her face and even in Ollie’s. How weird, to ask her for no reason whether she plays chess, and it wasn’t even related to what they were talking about. Cheerfully, however, she answers: No, I’m afraid not. I don’t have a brain for that kind of thing. I suppose I know what the pieces do, and that’s about it.<br>
        
        With grim regret at having spoken, Ivan nods his head.<br>
        
   Gesturing to the hall behind them, Ollie says: We don’t have much to boast about in the gender-equality department,unfortunately.<br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp<img src="./../img/short.jpg"width="400px"/><br><br>

 

<div>
    <p>
At a stopover in Ljubljana, the guards stand with their guns slung like guitars over their shoulders breathing boredom into the green air of the transit lounge. There is nothing to do. He and Courtney sit in chairs of a design Andrew has never seen before. They both agree it is a relief to be able to smoke on a plane again. No one meets them when they touch down in Struga, and the cab ride to town reminds Andrew of a spy movie: aging Mercedes, gravel roads, concrete housing units, bare bulbs visible from the road. The land is a war zone. He thinks they will never see morning.<br>
A man called Sasha has been assigned to squire the delegates around, show them the sights. Andrew and Courtney meet him in the hotel courtyard on their first afternoon, when they are still recovering from their stupefied sleep. 
</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
	“I am a journalist,” he declares. He wears white pants, a white short-sleeved cotton shirt, socks with sandals, sunglasses that cover half his face. <br>
“Things look okay here,” Courtney tells Sasha.<br>
“We are a civilized people,” Sasha says.<br>
“I didn’t say you weren’t.”<br>
“This is 1989. Nothing will happen. You’ll see.” <br> 
“I am an Andrew,” Andrew says.
</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p>
Sasha walks them through the town along the River Drin that flows through a canal out of Lake Ohrid. A bridge arcs across its green waters, joining the two halves of Struga. On it, a half-dozen boys in their teens wait for a turn to jump from the highest point into the current below. The river carries them downstream where they propel themselves toward a ladder attached to the canal’s stone wall, one arm outstretched to catch a rung. Andrew watches the jumpers as he and Courtney walk with Sasha, holding his breath until each boy returns to the water’s surface. His arms ache to join them.
  </div>
</p>

<div>
<p>
Sasha places himself between Andrew and Courtney on their tour, pointing out restaurants and art galleries. He talks more to Courtney than to Andrew, but Andrew hears everything he says. He hears enough to know he doesn’t need to listen. They come to a point where the road veers away from the river, and the neat masonry of the canal gives way to a garbage-strewn slope of dirt and grass.  Women are gathered on either shore with carpets that they soak in the water and beat with sticks. They wear long dresses, and their heads are covered. Andrew starts to laugh aloud at the sight of them, but Courtney stamps her foot twice to let him know he has to Stop Right Now.
</div>
</p>
	
<div>
<p>
	Andrew makes gestures of incomprehension with his hands.<br>
“Mein Mann,” she repeats, flexing her muscles and grimacing. “Arbeit.” Here she pretends to dig with a shovel. “Berlin.” <br>
	Andrew feels the urgency in her motions, how badly she wants him to understand, but panic begins to rise in his throat. He looks at his hands, holds them against each other and thinks how good everything will be once this woman goes away. When he brings his eyes up again, she is nowhere to be seen. 
</div>
</p>


  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="./../img/balkanized.jpg"width="530px"/><br>


<div>
<p>
Hours later, Andrew sits beside Sasha in the front passenger seat of a Yugo while Courtney spreads herself out in the back, falling asleep despite the noise of the tinny engine. They are on their way back from a monastery outside Ohrid, and Sasha is taking them to a riverside clearing where the organizers have prepared lunch. He is driving Andrew and Courtney separately because he knows some sights they might like to take in without the rest tagging along. Courtney falls asleep in the back seat, and Sasha uses the time to question Andrew about what he does, where he lives, why he doesn’t drive when Sasha offers to let him take the wheel. He wants to know why Andrew will let a woman work all day while he lies in the sun and stares at the sky. What kind of a man is he?  Andrew can tell Sasha doesn’t expect answers to his questions, so he doesn’t offer any.  Instead, he looks at the road that twists abruptly without warning as it follows the coast along the cliffs above the lake.  Sometimes, at particularly bad curves, they pass wrecks, the crumpled frames of cars, and Andrew is eager for more to appear. He knows his silence only confirms whatever opinion Sasha holds of him, and he watches himself let that happen.
</div>
</p>

<div>
<p>
Andrew slips through the arms of one of the dancers and walks over to Sasha and Courtney. They look like children, drinking beer from coloured glasses, Courtney’s legs pale below her shorts, Sasha the picture of a private school student in crisp whites. He feels happy for them. They make him want to cry.<br>
The hotel coffee is bad, a chicory substitute. It steams on a hot plate next to a bowl of stewed plums, bloated and rude, bobbing in thick syrup. Andrew pours himself a mug, walks out into the night toward the beachfront and takes in the starless view across the water. Albania is a little too obvious, as it has been every evening, the way a missing limb is. Lights of any kind disappear at the Macedonian border, nothing but darkness on the other side.“Forty feet down you can still pick out single bottles of beer,” he says, “read their labels, too.”
</div>
</p>

<div>
<p>
The clerk is right about the bottles. Dozens litter the lakebed. Earlier in the afternoon after the picnic, Andrew hung above them, suspended, bisected through the chest by the surface plane of Lake Ohrid, as though he was caught with his head in one world and his lower body in another. It made him dizzier than the vertigo that sometimes plagues him, though not a day goes by when he doesn’t fear falling again. Now, at night, the water is blessedly opaque, a silent solid, something a person could walk on if he had a mind to. Along the causeway above the shore, women pass hand in hand. There is no temptation to listen to people talking when he doesn’t know the language, and he is happy to give his ears a rest. So much to be thankful for.
</div>
</p>

<div>
<p>
Andrew turns back to look at the hotel. He picks out his balcony and then Courtney’s from the other balconies, all of them so different with their railings brightly festooned in underwear and socks and towels. 
Their hotel looks foolish from all angles, but it looks especially foolish from where Andrew is standing, the water at his back, taking in layer upon layer of cement and glass, curved to match the shoreline. Clusters of rooms are alight, but entire floors remain dark, and because of some trick with the landscape, the building appears to be listing, like an ocean liner going down. Courtney has gone out somewhere. She is angry with him. She would never accuse him of spoiling her time here, but Andrew knows she is unhappy, that she blames him for ruining her life.
</div>
</p>

<div>
<p>	
Soldiers are everywhere in the town, standing outside restaurants, walking down the middle of streets in groups of four and five. They are looking for members of the KLA who like to slip across the border for some R&R. In the town centre, a crowd has gathered in front of a structure that looks like a boat. Flowers hang from its mast, and torches burn at both ends. On a dais facing the crowd, a poet is reading his poems into a microphone, and his words echo against the buildings across the river. Courtney stands off to one side, Sasha next to her, his hands a flutter of thrusts and circles, as though he is punctuating a letter that hangs in the air in front of him. Andrew slips into shadow and passes a large van, inside of which are several men who, like the poet, are speaking into microphones. .
</div>
</p>

<div>
<p>
	He walks through the crowd and out onto the bridge closest to the lake.  The water tugs at
   the walls of the canal with a sound like leaves in a breeze. Boys in swimsuits begin to appear in the light cast by the torches, their skin golden against the dark. The evening is warm. People nearby are nursing beers and balancing plates of roasted meat. The boys cannot get enough of the game that has become even more addictive at night. Andrew is overjoyed to have found them again. They are too occupied to notice him as he moves into their midst, shedding his shirt, stepping out of his shoes to join them, a man among boys who are all bone and muscle, climbing with them up onto the bridge superstructure, yelling when they do.<br>
  “Tirana!” he bellows, a happy growl loud enough to turn the heads of the poetry crowd, Courtney among them, everyone straining to make out the large boy who follows the others as they disappear, one by one, below the rim of the bridge railings, his voice snuffed out when he hits the black water.

Fruit upon branches<br>
Delaying the end<br>
Trellises and semblances<br>
Meeting meant-to-be<br>
Seams and angles<br><br>

Repeating what it is worth<br>
To forget another hour<br>
Lose oneself in a labyrinth<br>
Devoid of a minotaur<br><br>

What door never opened<br>
Opens once and for all<br>
If only you find<br>
A flaw hidden in the design<br>
Disclosing a moment<br><br>

Time’s timeless print<br>
Gone now Here tomorrow<br>
Deer at the edge of a wood<br>
Turning still.<br><br>

Along the Pojoaque, cottonwoods form a swerving river of gold—<br><br>

a plumber’s daughter returned your call to say her father died—<br><br>

that moment slipped like water between your fingers—<br><br>

like light yellowing during an annular eclipse before it whitens into daylight—<br><br>

you tremble at the surge of yellow-gold light at your fingertips—<br><br>

the stretch of desire in your body like stringing a bow—<br><br>

you love how she gathers herself then gazes point-blank into your eyes—<br><br>

a Himalayan crane’s-bill opens violet flower after flower before the oncoming frost—<br><br>

at Troy, you ignored the ruins and marvelled at how silt from two rivers had distanced the sea—<br><br>

they brag at building the largest sandcastle on a beach—<br><br>

you grieve at the thought of deep-sea mining—<br><br>

we pick a few blood-red strawberries among the desiccating leaves—<br><br>

as sunlight heats a wall, you see how red petunias in a pot survive a freeze—<br><br>

water rises in a stone fountain and spills over the rim—<br><br>

you drink the candlelight before shimmering into flame—<br><br>

you take off, like a shaggy coat, what the world thinks and warm yourself at an outdoor fire—<br><br>

nocking an arrow, you thrill at the anticipation that spreads to your fingertips—<br><br>

you fly straight into the bull’s-eye of the day—<br><br><br>

There was a protest outside Thomas Jefferson<br><br>
and children were lying down histrionically,<br><br>
pretending the blast had killed them,<br><br>
or radiation, or nuclear darkness, closing their eyes<br><br>
no doubt to better picture it, and I took my place<br><br>
among them gingerly: let that searing asphalt<br><br>
ruin my jeans, not scorch my wrist—<br><br><br>

but my father looked down from his office tower<br><br>
and said, “That’s my son, there,<br><br>
in the ranks of the dead”—when the police came<br><br>
and began swinging clubs, giving free rein<br><br>
to their prancing horses, my father’s eyes<br><br><br>

narrowed and he said, “It’s over, some are running,<br><br>
some willing themselves to be even more dead,<br><br>
some hiding in each other’s arms”—gas cannisters<br><br>
flew and my father said, “That was long ago,<br><br>
that war never came, when he opened his eyes<br><br>
my son found himself in his lover’s arms”—<br><br><br>

“All around him the city as it once was,<br><br>
ranked tenements, laundry like sails on roofs,<br><br>
elms gray from coal smoke, but the sticks<br><br>
keep falling, and all around the great horses<br><br>
step daintily, afraid to trample the human body.”<br><br>
step daintily, afraid to trample the human body.”<br><br><br>
